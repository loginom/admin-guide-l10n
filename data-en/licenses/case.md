Both versions are available for the local dongle, but the network dongle is available only in the standard form factor.

## Comparison of the Physical Dongles Versions

### Local USB Dongle

Features:

* It must be inserted into the USB port of the computer used for Loginom start;
* Software is bound not to the computer parameters, but to the dongle.
* Loginom will be started only on computer with the installed dongle.
* Loginom cannot be used when connecting to the system in the mode of RDP session.

Advantages:

* It is distinguished by higher level of stability and reliability.
* License cannot be suspended due to the fact that a user didn't close Loginom on other computer.
* It is required to install only a driver for the local dongle operation, whereas a dedicated server is used for the network dongle and a key server must be installed on it.

### Network USB dongle

Features:

* It must be installed on a dedicated server and a key server must be additionally installed on it.
* The licenses are competitive. It means that the number of computers (or terminal sessions) on which Loginom applications have been started is limited.

Advantages:

* It is not required to install driver on each computer. It is sufficient just to install the program.
* Competitive licenses enable acquisition of less software, as the number of simaltaneously started applications is limited. It is particularly convenient in case of the corporate network usage when Loginom is typically started not by all users who installed it.
