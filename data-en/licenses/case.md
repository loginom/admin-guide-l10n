Both versions are available for the local dongle, but the network dongle is available only in the standard form factor.

## Comparison of Dongles Versions

### Local USB Dongle

Features:

* It must be inserted into the USB port of the computer on which Loginom will run;
* Software is not bound to the computer parameters, but to the dongle.
* Loginom will only run on a computer with an installed dongle.
* Loginom cannot be used when connecting to the system in RDP session mode.

Advantages:

* Higher level of stability and reliability.
* License cannot be suspended due to a user not having closed Loginom on another computer.
* Driver installation is only required for local dongle operation, whereas a dedicated server is used for the network dongle and a key server must be installed on it.

### Network USB Dongle

Features:

* It must be installed on a dedicated server and a key server must also be installed on it.
* The licenses are competitive, meaning that the number of computers (or terminal sessions) on which Loginom applications can run is limited.

Advantages:

* Installation of drivers is not required on each computer. It is sufficient just to install the program.
* Competitive licenses enable acquisition of less software, as the number of simultaneously started applications is limited. It is particularly convenient in the case of the corporate network usage when Loginom is typically not started by all users who installed it.
