# The Loginom Server

It is an analytical server responsible for loading tasks, calculations, model training, visualisation, rights management, etc. The Loginom Server is a key platform element required for teamwork.

The [Loginom Studio](../studio/README.md) provides for server management, configuration, visualisation and other operations. Other platform components, with the exception of the [Desktop](../desktop/README.md) component, can interact with the Loginom Server.

The Loginom Server is designated for deployment in the internal network when the work of more than one user from different working places is anticipated.
